# Test setup

### Requirements

Node v22.9
Rust 1.81
Solana 1.18.23

### Devnet Test Coin

For demonstration purposes, I already have created a coin on devnet, called MXNS, to simulate transactions on the real thing. And we already have 2 accounts prepared on devnet, BUYER and SELLER, each with SOL and MXNS balances, so they can pay each other as needed.

BUYER B2hv5LxMJuMkZo9FuHTTf3S5PzZUuZ5ohqBnEsKMFfnY
SELLER 9tHChTNsQeWpGoeD9Nzmi1boWPJoLd9mQ2rAnrWRyb9n
