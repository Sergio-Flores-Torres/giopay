# Test setup

### Requirements

Node v22.9
Rust 1.81
Solana 1.18.23

### Devnet Test Coin

For demonstration purposes, I already have created a coin on devnet, called MXNS, to simulate transactions on the real thing. And we already have 2 accounts prepared on devnet, BUYER and SELLER, each with SOL and MXNS balances, so they can pay each other as needed.

MXNS MINT AUTHORITY 5m3pa3zJAYVEWh1YCvFQVfiQnxuTSgLu6Nx2kdekXZWz
MXNS TOKEN ADDRESS 21HA7LeGM7AhaM3KHiRAQzJYZ8T6bXE1dxKWx7j4gvyk
MXNS ATA HOLDING ACCOUNT HBGHrBBGcCCHuTMFr5771ktRxbmd2eGVdwcSTDpRmm2c
